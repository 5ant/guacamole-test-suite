 What is guacamole-test-suite?
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-test-suite is a Java application that performs tests against
implementations of the Guacamole protocol, particularly guacd. It is intended
to stress-test aspects of protocol decoding and reveal bugs.

Currently, only one application is implemented in the suite: Stress. This
application connects to an instance of guacd based on arguments on the
command-line. By default, the application applies load passively, but it
can apply active load if requested.

Other applications will be implemented as needed.
